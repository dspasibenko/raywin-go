Raywin-go is a simple GUI library for embedded devices. It is built on top of [raylib-go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) and written in Go.

The main **highlights** are as follows:
- Simple programming interface suitable for straightforward UI projects.
- Initially built for an embedded device running on a Raspberry Pi with a small touchpad display.
- Can work directly with the display, eliminating the need for an X server or any window-based GUI system.
- Written in pure C under the hood using [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib), which is [wrapped for Go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go).
- Cross-platform, allowing development and debugging on a standard computer.

## Quick Introduction
While working on a home-built airplane, I designed and developed an observability system using a Raspberry Pi as the UX interface (cockpit touchpad display). To maintain stability and simplicity, I avoided running Linux in a full desktop configuration and did not include any GUI desktop environment. Unnecessary services were turned off. At the same time, I needed a reliable graphical interface to control my devices. This is where **raywin-go** initially came into play.

### Wait. What?
Yes, this is not a library people typically use for developing UX interfaces for laptops, desktops, or mobile devices like Android or iPhone. Instead, this library is designed to be embedded into a custom Linux setup with your own hardware and display. It's quite low-level â€” no React, no Qt, just almost pure graphics.

## How can I try this?
Raywin-go is cross-platform: it works on macOS and Linux (it should work on Windows, but it is not officially supported). Try out to run the [examples](examples) on your platform from the console:

```
cd examples/moving_boxes
go build .
./moving_boxes
```
or in IDE, just click "Run". For GoLand, for example, just run the main file from the `examples` subfolder.

To run your project on Linux in a special configuration without a GUI desktop or X server, build your project in DRM mode (see [here](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go)). For example, to run your project on Raspberry PI without GUI Desktop, use `drm` tag for build, something like this:
```
go build -tags "drm" -o ./build/ my_project_main.go
```
You can use other tags like `noaudio` etc., to control the raylib build configuration.
